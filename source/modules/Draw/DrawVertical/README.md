# DrawVertical

This module handles extension and retraction of the window, having it extend/retract vertically from the top/bottom of the screen.

This module does not handle the window's tilemap itself.

# User configuration

This module relies on something else (generally, the tilemap module) setting the `UI1_WIDTH` and `UI1_HEIGHT` definitions.
