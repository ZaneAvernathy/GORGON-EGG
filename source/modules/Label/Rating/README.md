# RatingLabel

This module draws a label graphic for the unit's rating, which is the sum of the unit's combat stats by default.

# User configuration

This module assumes that the palette for the label is already in PalRAM in the right slot.

## Simple definitions

  * `RTG_LABEL_X` and `RTG_LABEL_Y`: The coordinates of the label in tiles
  * `RTG_LABEL_BASE_TILE`: The VRAM tile index of the start of the label graphics
  * `RTG_LABEL_PALETTE`: The PalRAM index of the label palette
  * `RTG_LABEL_WIDTH`: The width of the label in tiles
